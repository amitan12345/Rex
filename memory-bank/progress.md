# Progress: Rex

## Project Status: Initial Setup

The Rex project is currently in the initial setup phase. The basic Laravel project structure has been established, but the implementation of the clean architecture layers and recruitment system features is pending.

## What Works

### Infrastructure
- Basic Laravel 12.0 project structure
- Composer dependencies configured
- Basic configuration files in place

### Documentation
- Memory bank initialized with project documentation
- Architecture and technical context documented
- Project guidelines established

## What's Left to Build

### Architecture Implementation
- [ ] Create clean architecture directory structure
- [ ] Implement domain layer (entities, value objects, aggregations)
- [ ] Implement application layer (use cases)
- [ ] Implement infrastructure layer (repositories, query services)
- [ ] Implement presentation layer (API controllers, requests, responders)
- [ ] Implement framework layer (service providers, middlewares)

### Core Features
- [ ] User management and authentication
- [ ] Job posting management
- [ ] Candidate application processing
- [ ] Interview scheduling
- [ ] Candidate evaluation
- [ ] Reporting and analytics

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Docker configuration
- [ ] Database migrations
- [ ] Seeders for test data
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for domain layer
- [ ] Unit tests for application layer
- [ ] Integration tests for infrastructure layer
- [ ] API tests for presentation layer

## Current Status by Component

### Domain Layer
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: High
- **Next Steps**: Define core entities and value objects

### Application Layer
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: High
- **Next Steps**: Define use cases for core features

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Next Steps**: Implement repositories for domain entities

### Presentation Layer
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Next Steps**: Define API endpoints and controllers

### Framework Layer
- **Status**: Basic setup complete
- **Priority**: Low
- **Next Steps**: Implement custom service providers

## Known Issues

- No known issues at this time as the project is in initial setup phase

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions
- **Framework Selection**: Laravel 12.0 chosen for its robust features and ecosystem
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture selected for maintainability and testability
- **Database**: MySQL selected for reliability and feature set
- **Development Environment**: Docker chosen for consistency across environments

### Future Decision Points
- **Authentication Strategy**: Determine the approach for user authentication
- **API Design**: Decide on RESTful vs. GraphQL for API implementation
- **Frontend Integration**: Determine how frontend will integrate with the API
- **Deployment Strategy**: Define the approach for production deployment
